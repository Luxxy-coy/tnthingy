## Holy UNblocker
Holy Unblocker LTS, an experimental web proxy service, can bypass web filters or 'blockers' regardless of whether the method of censorship is client-side or network-based. This includes the potential ability to bypass content blockers overseas, Chrome extensions, localized client firewalls, and network-related filters.

This project serves mostly as a proof of concept for the ideal clientless solution to bypassing censorship. Being a secure web proxy service, it supports numerous sites while being updated frequently and concentrating on detail with design, mechanics, and features.

Works with a large number of sites, including YouTube, Discord, and more! Also has a good amount of locally hosted games featured on the site.
