## Holy Unblocker
* Holy Unblocker LTS, an experimental web proxy service, can bypass web filters or 'blockers' regardless of whether the method of censorship is client-side or network-based. This includes the potential ability to bypass content blockers overseas, Chrome extensions, localized client firewalls, and network-related filters.

* This project serves mostly as a proof of concept for the ideal clientless solution to bypassing censorship. Being a secure web proxy service, it supports numerous sites while being updated frequently and concentrating on detail with design, mechanics, and features.

* Works with a large number of sites, including YouTube, Discord, and more! Also has a good amount of locally hosted games featured on the site.

**Features**
* Tab customization using the Options menu for improved stealth
* Considerable variety with the open selection of proxy types
* Game library with moderately decent titles
* Has frequent support articles for issues relating to the various proxy instances

## Anura OS

* What is AnuraOS?**

* An entirely local browser-based "OS" and development environment with complete graphical Linux emulation, visually based on ChromiumOS. See a demo here, fully in your browser.

* Anura OS has only been extensively tested on Chromium and Safari. Although nearly everything should work on Firefox, you may run into problems with instability.

* Anura shows as more of a proof-of-concept with what's possible on the modern web rather than an actual product. However, it proves useful in many actual cases and is a useful educational tool.

# Adrift

**What is Adrift?**

Adrift is a fast and modern decentralized web proxy network, utilizing transport over WebRTC.

Clients will invisibly connect to one of several tracking servers to exchange an "offer". From there, it uses NAT traversal to link up with a random exit node also running adrift, without the need to port forward. This lightens the load on individial server hosters and makes the network difficult to effectively block. If you're familiar with tor snowflake, you can think of this as tor for the web

**What is dreamland?**

dreamland is a reactive JSX-inspired UI library with no virtual dom and no build step. It is less than 3kb minified (smaller than preact), gradually integrates with existing plain JS projects, and is reasonably easy to learn
