## Holy Unblocker
* Holy Unblocker LTS, an experimental web proxy service, can bypass web filters or 'blockers' regardless of whether the method of censorship is client-side or network-based. This includes the potential ability to bypass content blockers overseas, Chrome extensions, localized client firewalls, and network-related filters.

* This project serves mostly as a proof of concept for the ideal clientless solution to bypassing censorship. Being a secure web proxy service, it supports numerous sites while being updated frequently and concentrating on detail with design, mechanics, and features.

* Works with a large number of sites, including YouTube, Discord, and more! Also has a good amount of locally hosted games featured on the site.

**Features**
* Tab customization using the Options menu for improved stealth
* Considerable variety with the open selection of proxy types
* Game library with moderately decent titles
* Has frequent support articles for issues relating to the various proxy instances

## Anura OS

* What is AnuraOS?**

* An entirely local browser-based "OS" and development environment with complete graphical Linux emulation, visually based on ChromiumOS. See a demo here, fully in your browser.

* Anura OS has only been extensively tested on Chromium and Safari. Although nearly everything should work on Firefox, you may run into problems with instability.

* Anura shows as more of a proof-of-concept with what's possible on the modern web rather than an actual product. However, it proves useful in many actual cases and is a useful educational tool.
